# Introduction

## About this Workshop

IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment written in Java for developing computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages. It is developed by JetBrains and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition.

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

* Get an idea of how IntelliJ IDEA and its new GenAI plugin works
* Use the GenAI IntelliJ plugin to generate some code
* Deploy this code into OCI

## Overview

IntelliJ IDEA is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java and Kotlin designed to maximize developer productivity. It does the routine and repetitive tasks for you by providing clever code completion, static code analysis, and refactorings, and lets you focus on the bright side of software development, making it not only productive but also an enjoyable experience.
Multi-platform

IntelliJ IDEA is a cross-platform IDE that provides consistent experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

    For more information about OS-specific instructions, refer to Install IntelliJ IDEA.

    For more information about choosing the right keymap for your operating system, and learning the most useful shortcuts, refer to IntelliJ IDEA keyboard shortcuts.

### Supported languages

Development of modern applications involves using multiple languages, tools, frameworks, and technologies. IntelliJ IDEA is designed as an IDE for JVM languages but numerous plugins can extend it to provide a polyglot experience.
JVM languages

Use IntelliJ IDEA to develop applications in the following languages that can be compiled into the JVM bytecode, namely:

* Java
* Kotlin
* Scala
* Groovy

Plugins bundled with IntelliJ IDEA and available out of the box add support for some of the most popular languages, namely:

* Python (full PyCharm functionality)
* Ruby (full RubyMine functionality)
* PHP (full PhpStorm functionality)
* SQL (full DataGrip functionality)
* Go (full GoLand functionality)
* JavaScript (full WebStorm functionality)
* TypeScript (full WebStorm functionality)
* Thymeleaf
* JSON
* Markdown
* HTML
* XML and XSL
* XPath and XSLT
* Velocity and FreeMarker
* Stylesheets (CSS, Less, Sass)
* Dart
* Erlang

> **Note**: C/C++ are not officially supported in IntelliJ IDEA, but you can use CLion.

You can browse JetBrains Marketplace to find an official plugin that adds support for almost any language, framework or technology used today, or for third-party plugins. For more information about managing plugins, refer to Install plugins.
Do I need a language plugin for IntelliJ IDEA or a separate IDE?ï»¿

IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is a superset of most IntelliJ platform-based IDEs. If the bundled language plugins are enabled, it includes support for all technologies that are available within our more specific IDEs, such as PyCharm, WebStorm, PHPStorm, and so on.

So, for example, if your application's codebase is mainly in Java, but it also uses Python scripts, we recommend using IntelliJ IDEA in combination with the bundled Python plugin. If your codebase is mainly in Python, PyCharm is the right IDE for you.

## IntelliJ IDEA editions

IntelliJ IDEA comes in two editions:

    IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate: a full-featured Java and Kotlin IDE. It includes all the features of the Community edition, plus adds support for languages that other IntelliJ platform-based IDEs focus on, as well as support for a variety of server-side and front-end frameworks, application servers, integration with database and profiling tools, and more.

    IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition: a free IDE built on open-source code that provides essential features for Java and Kotlin enthusiasts.

See the IntelliJ IDEA editions comparison matrix.

## The Early Access program

IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is available for free within the Early Access Program (EAP). EAP builds are published before the release of a stable product version, and you can download them to try out the new features before they are publicly available in return for your feedback. EAP builds are configured to collect feature usage statistics, and are a valuable source of information for our developers. You can also report an issue if you encounter any problems.

> **Note**: Release Candidate (RC) builds published before a release are also available for download, but require a paid license. Preview builds published after the release of a stable version that are followed by an official update, also require a paid license and cannot be evaluated for free.

## User Interface

IntelliJ IDEA provides an editor-centric environment. It follows your context and brings up the necessary tools automatically to help you minimize the risk of interrupting the developer's flow.
